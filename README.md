# gap-qa-automation-bootcamp

<br />Final Project

<br />Collaborator: Jose Garcia

<br />Reason: This was design for an Automation GAP Internal BootCamp 2021

<br />Notes
<br /> - Applying what was learned on the Bootcamp a series of API calls and UI integration tests were develop to solve following modules:

<br /> Module 1: Create and Delete Coupons
<br /> Module 2: Create and Delete Order
<br /> Module 3: Get the list of all available products

<br />Based on those modules we able to solve the challenge


<br />Set up:
<br />On the set up proccess we would be creating a new coupon and order, those would be used during the API and UI Integration tests


<br />TearDown: We would be incharge of deleting all information created on the set up proccess to avoid inneccesary information o the DB
